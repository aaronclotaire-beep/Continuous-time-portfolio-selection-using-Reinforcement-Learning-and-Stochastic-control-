# Continuous-time-portfolio-selection-using-Reinforcement-Learning-and-Stochastic-control-
This project formulates the continuous-time portfolio allocation problem as an Exploratory Mean–Variance (EMV) problem under entropy-regularized stochastic control, deriving a parametric optimal policy and implementing the EMV algorithm on both simulated and real data.
